## Introduction

Define clusters and tasks for system administration or code deployment, then execute them on one or many remote machines.

Clojure-control depends only on OpenSSH and clojure on the local control machine.Remote machines simply need a standard sshd daemon.

The idea came from [node-control](https://github.com/tsmith/node-control).
