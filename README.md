## Introduction

Define clusters and tasks for system administration or code deployment, then execute them on one or many remote machines.

Clojure-control depends only on OpenSSH and clojure on the local control machine.Remote machines simply need a standard sshd daemon.

The idea came from [node-control](https://github.com/tsmith/node-control).

##Leiningen Usagew

To include clojure-control,add:

   		 [control "0.2.0"]

##Build

Clone this repository with git or download the latest version using the GitHub repository Downloads link.
Use [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to build project

		lein jar

And there will be a file named "control-0.1.0.jar" at project directory.Then use as a standard jar by adding it to your classpath.

Or you can just add src/control/core.clj to your classpath.

##Getting started

Get the current date from the two machines listed in the 'mycluster' config with a single command:

		(ns samples
		  (:use [control.core :only [deftask defcluster scp ssh begin]]))

		;;define clusters
		(defcluster :mycluster
		 :clients [
				   { :host "a.domain.com" :user "alogin"}
				   { :host "b.domain.com" :user "blogin"}
				   ])

		;;define tasks			   
	    (deftask :date "Get date"
		 	  []
			  (ssh "date"))

		;;start running
		(begin)

If saved in a file named "controls.clj",run with
   		
		java -cp clojure.jar:clojure-contrib.jar:control-0.2.0.jar clojure.main controls.clj mycluster date

If you have a script to start clojure,it can be started simply
   
		clojure controls.clj mycluster date

Each machine execute "date" command ,and the output form the remote machine is printed to the console.Exmaple console output

	 	Performing mycluster
		Performing date for a.domain.com
		a.domain.com:ssh: date
		a.domain.com:stdout: Sun Jul 24 19:14:09 CST 2011
		a.domain.com:exit: 0
		Performing date for b.domain.com
		b.domain.com:ssh: date
		b.domain.com:stdout: Sun Jul 24 19:14:09 CST 2011
		b.domain.com:exit: 0

Each line of output is labeled with the address of the machine the command was
executed on. The actual command sent and the user used to send it is
displayed. stdout and stderr output of the remote process is identified
as well as the final exit code of the local ssh command. 

## SCP files

If you want to scp files to remote machines,you could use scp function
   
      (deftask :deploy "scp files to remote machines"
	        []
   	  		(scp ["release1.tar.gz" "release2.tar.gz"] "/home/alogin/"))

We defined a new task named "deploy" to copy release1.tar.gz and release2.tar.gz to remote machine's /home/alogin directory.


   
## Define clusters

As you seen the example in GettingStarted,you could use cluster macro to define cluster making remote machines in a group.
If your machines have the same user,you can use cluster macro more simply

   		(defcluster :mycluster
				 :user "login"
				 :addresses ["a.domain.com" "b.domain.com"])

Also,you can configure :clients for special machines:

		 (defcluster :mycluster
		 		  :clients [
				 		   { :host "c.domain.com" :user "clogin"}
				 		   ]
				  :user "login"	
				  :addresses ["a.domain.com" "b.domain.com"])

Then clojure-control will use "clogin" to login c.domain.com,but use "login" to login a.domain.com and b.domain.com.


##Pass arguments to task

As you seen,define task using a argument vector to pass arguments for task.For example,i want to scp special file to remote machines,then

   	    (deftask :deploy "deploy a file to remote machine"
			  [file]
			  (scp [file] "/home/login"))

Run with

	 	clojure controls.clj mycluster deploy release.tar.gz

Then "release.tar.gz" in command line arguments would be passed to scp macro as "file" argument,then copy it to remote machines.
